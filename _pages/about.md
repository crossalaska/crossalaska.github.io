## Why are we doing this trip?

We are excited to do a long wilderness trip together! It is a dream for both of us from before we met. We both have had many adventures before, some together and some by ourselves, but nothing this extensive. We traveled to Alaska's Wrangell - St. Elias National Park in 2019 and we loved it! Although initially we had planned to hike the Andes through the Greater Patagonia Trail, we changed plans and instead started looking closer to us. 

## Are you prepared?

Probably not! We have a lot of experiences, but in this trip will be our first packrafting adventure. We got into seakayaking a couple of years ago and we have some relevant experience, but whitewater is a new thing for us. We have hiked offtrail in remote areas before, but the vastness of some of the places we plant to go dwarfs most of our prior experiences. 

## Has anyone done something similar?

Definitely. Many goldminers endured extremely harsh conditions years ago with far less fancier equipment. Most recently, several trips have done long journeys through Alaska and the Inside Passage:

- Erin McKittick and Bretwood Higman year-long trip from Seattle to the Aleutian Islands ([book](http://www.groundtruthtrekking.org/Book/)).
- Caroline Van Hemert and Patrick Farrell 4000-mile journey from Bellingham to the Arctic ([book](https://www.carolinevanhemert.com/book))
- Andrew Skurka's Alaska-Yukon Expedition ([report](https://andrewskurka.com/adventures/alaska-yukon-expedition/))

We are not hoping to best them in any way, but enjoy the wilderness and learn from it by ourselves.
