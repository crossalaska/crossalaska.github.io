## Who is going on this journey?

Salom√© is from Switzerland and moved to Seattle after meeting and falling in love with Ricardo. She is a lawyer working in an environmental organization in Seattle. She is passionate about environmental protection, human rights, women's rights, and the outdoors. Her parents took her on many day-hikes throughout her childhood, some even before she could walk. Volunteering for the Bergwaldprojekt in her mid-20s, a small non-profit in Switzerland organizing trail and forest maintenance volunteer work weeks in remote areas of the Swiss alps, she rediscovered her love for the mountains and for hiking. She started going on many multi-day backpacking trips, in the beginning in the Swiss and French Alps, later abroad in Lesotho, Tajikistan, Iceland, Madagascar and South America. Since moving to Seattle, she has enjoyed backpacking in the Cascades, the Sierras and Wind River Range as well as kayaking and paddle boarding in the Pujet Sound and the San Juan Islands.

Ricardo is from Spain but has been living in Seattle for over 10 years now. He is a researcher in computer science---

We met in Patagonia over 5 years ago. As our first vacaiton together, we crossed Iceland from the north to the south, a journey that brought us closer together. We have since explored the West Coast backpacking, kayaking and backcountry skiing and look forward to our next big adventure.

## Why are we going on this journey?

We are excited to do a long wilderness trip together! It has beeen a dream for both of us since before we met and has become a joint dream since. We have both gone on many wilderness adventures before, some together, and some by ourselves - but nothing on this scale. We backpacked across Alaska's Wrangell - St. Elias National Park in 2019 and cambe back home with the dream of returning to Alaska! Although initially we had planned to hike the Andes through the Greater Patagonia Trail, COVID changed plans and instead we stared looking for an adventure closer to our home, Seattle. 

## Are we prepared?

Probably not! But will we ever be? We have a lot of long-distance backpacking experiences, but this journed will be our first packrafting adventure. We got into seakayaking a couple of years ago and we have explored the Puget Sound and San Juan Islands on multilple sea kayakign trips, but whitewater is a new experience for us. We have hiked offtrail in remote areas before, but the vastness of some of the places we plan to go dwarfs most of our prior experiences. 

## Has anyone done something similar?

Definitely. Many native americans, goldminers and early-day explorers walked and paddled through Alaska and expereinced harsh conditions many years before our modern, fancy and light-weight equipment. Most recently, several adventurers have crossed Alaska:

- Erin McKittick and Bretwood Higman's year-long journey from Seattle to the Aleutian Islands ([book](http://www.groundtruthtrekking.org/Book/)).
- Caroline Van Hemert and Patrick Farrell's 4000-mile journey from Bellingham to the Arctic ([book](https://www.carolinevanhemert.com/book))
- Andrew Skurka's Alaska-Yukon Expedition ([report](https://andrewskurka.com/adventures/alaska-yukon-expedition/))

We are not hoping to best them in any way, but instead are inspired by their journeys, and look forward to our own version of wilderness adventure.
