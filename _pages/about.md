## Who is going on this journey?

### Salomé
I am a lawyer from Switzerland and moved to Seattle after meeting and falling in love with Ricardo. My parents took me on many day-hikes throughout my childhood, some even before I could walk. However, it wasn't until I volunteered for a small non-profit in a remote valled in the swiss alps building trails and doing forestry work that I rediscovered her love for mountains and for hiking, and that I realized that coming bottom of my class in sports does not have to stop me from being active and do what I love. After that, I started going on many multi-day backpacking trips, in the beginning in the Swiss and French Alps, later abroad in Lesotho, Tajikistan, Iceland, Madagascar and on a seven-month hike across the andes in South America. After moving to Seattle, I have spent many long weekends hiking and paddling in the Pacific North West and has hiked 900 miles on the PCT in California. I am passionate about environmental protection, and encouraging women to to on bigger outdoorsy adventures. I love exploring remote, very little travelled areas of our wonderful planet on foot.

### Ricardo 
I am from Madrid, Spain but have been living in Seattle since 2010. I moved to Seattle for my PhD in Computer Science and during that time I got to really love the outdoors. Before that, I really enjoyed traveling during my undergraduate years in Europe, including an Eurorail trip in Eastern Europe and trips for competitions all around the world. Between undergrad and grad, I spent 5 months traveling the world, including a 850 mile bicycle ride around New Zealand and outworldly experiences in Vanuatu. As I settled in Seattle, I was able to pursue my dream of learning how to drive and buying a car (not that common in Spain!). In rapid succession, I learned how to (heavy) powder skiing, backcountry skiing, and mountaineering. Unfortunately, the new adventures brought a series of injuries, including an ACL tear that wore off my unhealthy obsession with skiing. Next, I picked up backpacking, and started enjoying the Cascades. My next big adventure took me to a week-long hike in Torres del Paine where I met Salomé.

I am currently a researcher at Google working on the future of communication, and my biggest passion is making pretty pictures that tell a story. You can read more about my work [here](http://ricardomartinbrualla.com).

### Us

We met in Patagonia over 5 years ago. As our first vacation together, we crossed Iceland from North to South, a journey that confirmed our love for each other. We have since gone on many adventures together, in the US and abroad, backpacking, kayaking and backcountry skiing.

## Why are we going on this journey?

We are excited to do a long wilderness trip together! It has beeen a dream for both of us since before we met and has become a joint dream since. We have both gone on many wilderness adventures before, some together, and some by ourselves - but nothing on this scale. We backpacked across Alaska's Wrangell - St. Elias National Park in 2019 and came back home with the dream of returning to Alaska!  

## Are we prepared?

Probably not! But will we ever be? We have a lot of long-distance backpacking experiences, but this journed will be our first packrafting adventure. We got into seakayaking a couple of years ago and we have explored the Puget Sound and San Juan Islands on multilple sea kayakign trips, but whitewater is a new experience for us. We have hiked offtrail in remote areas before, but the vastness of some of the places we plan to go dwarfs most of our prior experiences. 

## Has anyone done something similar?

Definitely. Many native americans, goldminers, and early-day explorers walked and paddled through Alaska and experienced harsh conditions many years before our modern, light-weight equipment. Most recently, several adventurers have crossed Alaska:

- Erin McKittick and Bretwood Higman's year-long journey from Seattle to the Aleutian Islands ([book](http://www.groundtruthtrekking.org/Book/)).
- Caroline Van Hemert and Patrick Farrell's 4000-mile journey from Bellingham to the Arctic ([book](https://www.carolinevanhemert.com/book))
- Andrew Skurka's Alaska-Yukon Expedition ([report](https://andrewskurka.com/adventures/alaska-yukon-expedition/))

We are not hoping to best them in any way, but instead are inspired by their journeys, and look forward to our own version adventure.
