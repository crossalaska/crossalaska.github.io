## Who is going on this journey?

### Salom√©
I am a lawyer from Switzerland and moved to Seattle after meeting and falling in love with Ricardo. My parents took me on many day-hikes throughout my childhood, some even before I could walk. However, it wasn't until I volunteered for a small non-profit in a remote valled in the swiss alps building trails and doing forestry work that I rediscovered her love for mountains and for hiking, and that I realized that coming bottom of my class in sports does not have to stop me from being active and do what I love. After that, I started going on many multi-day backpacking trips, in the beginning in the Swiss and French Alps, later abroad in Lesotho, Tajikistan, Iceland, Madagascar and on a seven-month hike across the andes in South America. After moving to Seattle, I have spent many long weekends hiking and paddling in the Pacific North West and has hiked 900 miles on the PCT in California. I am passionate about environmental protection, and encouraging women to to on bigger outdoorsy adventures. I love exploring remote, very little travelled areas of our wonderful planet on foot.

### Ricardo 
I am a researcher in computer science from Spain but has been living in Seattle for over 10 years now...

We met in Patagonia over 5 years ago. As our first vacaiton together, we crossed Iceland from the north to the south, a journey that confirmed our love for eachother. We have since gone on many adventures otgether, in the US and abroad, backpacking, kayaking and backcountry skiing 

## Why are we going on this journey?

We are excited to do a long wilderness trip together! It has beeen a dream for both of us since before we met and has become a joint dream since. We have both gone on many wilderness adventures before, some together, and some by ourselves - but nothing on this scale. We backpacked across Alaska's Wrangell - St. Elias National Park in 2019 and cambe back home with the dream of returning to Alaska! Although initially we had planned to hike the Andes through the Greater Patagonia Trail, COVID changed plans and instead we stared looking for an adventure closer to our home, Seattle. 

## Are we prepared?

Probably not! But will we ever be? We have a lot of long-distance backpacking experiences, but this journed will be our first packrafting adventure. We got into seakayaking a couple of years ago and we have explored the Puget Sound and San Juan Islands on multilple sea kayakign trips, but whitewater is a new experience for us. We have hiked offtrail in remote areas before, but the vastness of some of the places we plan to go dwarfs most of our prior experiences. 

## Has anyone done something similar?

Definitely. Many native americans, goldminers, and early-day explorers walked and paddled through Alaska and experienced harsh conditions many years before our modern, light-weight equipment. Most recently, several adventurers have crossed Alaska:

- Erin McKittick and Bretwood Higman's year-long journey from Seattle to the Aleutian Islands ([book](http://www.groundtruthtrekking.org/Book/)).
- Caroline Van Hemert and Patrick Farrell's 4000-mile journey from Bellingham to the Arctic ([book](https://www.carolinevanhemert.com/book))
- Andrew Skurka's Alaska-Yukon Expedition ([report](https://andrewskurka.com/adventures/alaska-yukon-expedition/))

We are not hoping to best them in any way, but instead are inspired by their journeys, and look forward to our own version of wilderness adventure.
